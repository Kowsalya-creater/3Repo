    <p id="p1"> Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI,[1] or GAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.
        [2][3][4] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[5][6] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural 
        language prompts.Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s. These include 
        chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI 
        generators such as Sora.[9][10][11][12] Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.
