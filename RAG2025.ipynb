It was hosted from 5 October to 19 November 2023 across ten venues in India. This was the fourth World Cup held in India, but the first where India was the sole host.\\nThe tournament was contested by ten national teams, maintaining the same format used in 2019. After six weeks of round-robin matches, India, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand finished as the top four and qualified for the knockout stage. In the knockout stage, India and Australia beat New Zealand and South Africa, respectively, to advance to the final, played on 19 November at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Australia won the final by six wickets, winning their sixth Cricket World Cup title.\\nVirat Kohli was named the player of the tournament and also scored the most runs, while Mohammed Shami was the leading wicket-taker. A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended the matches, the highest number in any Cricket World Cup to date.[1] The tournament final set viewership records in India, drawing 518 million viewers, with a peak of 57 million streaming viewers.\\n\\n\\nBackground\\nOn 11 December 2017, India was announced by the ICC as hosts of the 2023 Cricket World Cup; while India had served as a co-host during three previous tournaments (most recently in 2011, which it co-hosted with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh), it would mark the first Cricket World Cup to be hosted solely by India.[2]\\nOriginally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023.[3][4] In July 2020 it was announced that due to the disruption of the qualification schedule by the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the tournament would be delayed to October.[5][6] The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June 2023.[7][8]\\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the tournament after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan.[9][10] This issue was resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the tournament would be hosted using a hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.[11][12]\\nThis was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.[13]\\n\\nQualification\\nHighlighted are the countries that participated in the 2023 Cricket World Cup. \\xa0\\xa0Qualified as host \\xa0\\xa0Qualified via the 2020–2023 Super League \\xa0\\xa0Qualified via the 2023 Qualifier \\xa0\\xa0Participated in the qualifier but failed to qualify\\nMain article: 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification\\nOther than India, who qualified as hosts, all teams had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023.\\nAs a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West Indies, who failed to progress for the first time after their defeat to Scotland.[14] Full members Ireland and Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing.[15] The final qualification spot was decided by an eliminator match between associate members Scotland and the Netherlands,[16] with the Dutch side taking the final place.[14]\\n\\n\\n\\nMeans of qualification\\n\\nDate\\n\\nVenue\\n\\nBerths\\n\\nQualified\\n\\n\\nHost nation\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0India\\n\\n\\nICC Super League\\n\\n30 July 2020 – 14 May 2023\\n\\nVarious\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\xa0Afghanistan\\xa0Australia\\xa0Bangladesh\\xa0England\\xa0New Zealand\\xa0Pakistan\\xa0South Africa\\n\\n\\nQualifier\\n\\n18 June 2023 – 9 July 2023\\n\\nZimbabwe\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0Sri Lanka\\xa0Netherlands\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\nVenues\\nMumbaiKolkataBangalorePuneNew DelhiHyderabadChennaiAhmedabadDharamshalaLucknowclass=notpageimage| 2023 Cricket World Cup venues\\nThe tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first and second semi-finals were held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata respectively, while the final took place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.[7]\\nThe BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. Chidambaram Stadium installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.[17]\\nWith the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men\\'s T20 World Cup). These included using a specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around 70\\xa0m (77 yards) at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to encourage seam bowling over spin bowling.[18]\\n\\n\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nStadium\\n\\nCapacity[19]\\n\\nNo. of matches\\n\\n\\nAhmedabad\\n\\nNarendra Modi Stadium\\n\\n132,000\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nBangalore\\n\\nM.

The panel selected 12 umpires to officiate at the tournament: three from Australia, four from England, four from Asia (one each from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), two each from New Zealand and South Africa and one from the West Indies. It also selected four match referees for the event.[23][24]\\nWarm-up matches\\nWarm-up matches were held from 29 September to 3 October 2023 at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, Assam Cricket Association Stadium in Guwahati, and Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram.[7]\\nIndia\\'s warm-up fixtures were announced on 27 June.

The event began with the launching of the trophy into the stratosphere by Sent Into Space and landing at Modi Stadium—becoming the first sports trophy to have ever been sent into space.[40]\\nThe ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup in August. The mascots were a male and female duo named \"Tonk\" and \"Blaze\" from the fictional cricketing utopia \"Crictoverse\".[41][42]\\nThe official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled \"Dil Jashn Bole\" (transl.\\u2009Heart say celebrate) was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Shloke Lal and Saaveri Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan.[43] However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.[44]\\nAhead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue.[45] The ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a closing ceremony ahead of the final.[46] During this a drone show was held.[47][48]\\n\\nBroadcasting\\nDisney Star served as host broadcaster of the tournament in association with ICC TV;[49] in India, all matches were televised by Star Sports and streamed by Disney+ Hotstar, with coverage available in English and eight regional languages.[50] Amid competition with JioCinema for domestic cricket rights,[51][52] Disney announced that all matches would be available on Disney+ Hotstar for free on mobile devices. The broadcasts featured expanded player and Hawk-Eye ball tracking features (building upon those introduced in the 2022 men\\'s T20 World Cup) for visualizing shots and fielding, and dedicated vertical video feeds of each match designed for streaming on smartphones. Commentary on the ICC\\'s English-language world feed was led by Ricky Ponting and Eoin Morgan among others.[51][49]\\nThe ICC projected that global live viewing minutes of the tournament had increased by 17% over 2019.[53] In India, Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) ratings reported that the final was seen on linear television by 518 million people in India, and Disney reported that streams peaked at 57 million concurrent viewers on Hotstar—both setting new records.[52]\\n\\nPrize money\\nThe ICC allocated a pool of US$10 million in prize money for the tournament, with payouts remaining the same as the 2019 and 2015 tournaments. Australia, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $1,600,000.
